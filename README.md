Of course. A good README.md is the most important document for any project. Here is a detailed and well-structured README.md file for you.

Instructions
In the root folder of your project (saas-notes-app), create a file named README.md.

Copy the entire content below and paste it into that new file.

Replace the placeholder links like [YOUR_FRONTEND_URL] with your actual Vercel deployment URLs.

Commit and push this final file to GitHub.

YardStick-NotesApp: A Multi-Tenant SaaS Application
This is a full-stack, multi-tenant SaaS (Software as a Service) Notes Application. It allows different companies (tenants) to sign up, manage their users, and create, edit, and delete notes within their own secure, isolated environment.

The project is built with a modern technology stack and deployed on Vercel.

## Live Demo
Frontend Application: [YOUR_FRONTEND_URL]

Backend Health Status: [YOUR_BACKEND_URL]/health

## Core Features
Multi-Tenancy Architecture: Securely supports multiple companies with strict data isolation.

User Authentication: JWT-based login and signup system.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Admin: Can invite new users and manage the company's subscription.

Member: Can only manage notes.

Subscription Gating: A "Free" plan limited to 3 notes and a "Pro" plan with unlimited notes.

Notes Management (CRUD): Full functionality to create, read, update, and delete notes.

User Invites: Admins can invite new members to join their tenant.

## Technology Stack
### Backend
Runtime: Node.js

Framework: Express.js

Database: PostgreSQL (hosted on Neon)

Database Client: node-postgres (pg)

Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Validation: Zod

### Frontend
Library: React.js

Framework: Create React App

Styling: Tailwind CSS

State Management: React Context API

API Communication: Axios

Routing: React Router

### Deployment
Platform: Vercel (for both frontend and backend)

Version Control: Git & GitHub

## Architectural Decisions
### Multi-Tenancy Strategy
This application uses a shared schema with a tenant_id column approach for multi-tenancy.

Reasoning: This model was chosen for its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ease of development and maintenance, making it a robust and common pattern for many SaaS applications.

Implementation: Every table in the database that holds tenant-specific data (e.g., users, notes) has a mandatory tenant_id foreign key column. Every single backend API query that accesses this data is programmatically filtered by the tenant_id of the currently authenticated user. This ID is extracted from their JWT on every request, ensuring that a user from one tenant can never access data belonging to another.

## Local Development Setup
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or later)

npm

Git

A free PostgreSQL database (e.g., from Neon)

### Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Gyaan507/YardStick-NotesApp.git
cd YardStick-NotesApp
Setup the Backend:

Bash

# Navigate to the backend folder
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file and add your variables
# DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string"
# JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_string"

# Run the database setup and seed scripts
node db-setup.js
node seed.js

# Start the backend server
node index.js
The backend will be running at http://localhost:3001.

Setup the Frontend:

Bash

# Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the React development server
npm start
The frontend will open and run at http://localhost:3000.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as a monorepo with two main folders: backend and frontend.
